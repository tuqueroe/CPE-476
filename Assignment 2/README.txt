First I uploaded Romi-RPi-I2CSlave Arduino code to the Romi control board
This is found in the following directory
Arduino/Romi-RPi-I2CSlave directory

Second I modified the the source code for romipi_astar from this github raw file
https://github.com/ftPeter/RomiPi/blob/master/romipi_astar/src/romipi_astar/romipi_driver.py
I modified the romipi_driver.py file by changing the square and circle functions.
the modified source code ban be found in the following directory
romipi_astar/romipi_driver.py

Last I made a python code to execute the square and circle function
romi_square_circle.py

This was tested on a flat wooden surface.
